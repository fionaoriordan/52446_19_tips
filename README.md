This repository is my submission for Project 2019, Module 52446: Fundamentals of Data Analysis. The project is an exploration and analysis of the well known python seaborn tips data set using the python packages seaborn (https://seaborn.pydata.org) and jupyter notebook (https://jupyter.org/). The project sets out to describe the tips dataset, to use regression to explore the relationship between tips and bill amount and then the relationship between tip percentage and bill amount, to analyse the influence of variable sex and smoking and lastly to provide some additional insights into bill & tip per diner and part sizes.
